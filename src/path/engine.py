"""Learning Path Engine — decide what a student should learn next.

This is the proactive brain of the platform. Given a student and a chapter, it
reads the student's persisted progress and the chapter's prerequisite-ordered
concepts, and answers two questions:

    next_concept(student_id, chapter_id)  -> the single best next step + why
    get_roadmap(student_id, chapter_id)   -> every concept tagged
                                             mastered / available / locked

The engine never invents pedagogy of its own: ordering and prerequisites come
from the curriculum spine (src/curriculum), mastery comes from the progress
store (src/progress). The engine is the rule that combines them.

`next_concept` policy, in order:
  1. Spaced repetition — if a mastered concept in this chapter hasn't been
     revisited in REVIEW_INTERVAL_DAYS, surface it for review first. A forgotten
     prerequisite quietly undermines everything built on top of it.
  2. Forward progress — otherwise recommend the first not-yet-mastered concept
     (in teaching order) whose prerequisites are ALL mastered.
  3. Done / blocked — if nothing is learnable, say whether the chapter is fully
     mastered or blocked on a prerequisite from elsewhere.
