"""Persistent student-progress store (SQLite).

This is the durable version of the in-session mastery ledger that app.py keeps
in `st.session_state.mastery`. One row per (student, concept) records the
student's best score, attempt count, derived mastery status, and when they last
saw the concept. The Learning Path Engine (src/path/engine.py) reads this store
to decide what to teach next.

Status vocabulary and thresholds are identical to app.py's `_status_from_score`
(score 0-3 → mastered / partial / not_yet) so the live UI and the persisted
record never disagree.

The database path is resolved from the ECOLEARN_PROGRESS_DB env var at call
time (default: data/progress.db). Reading it lazily — not at import — lets
tests point at a temp file before the first call.
